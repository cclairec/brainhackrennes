	            will be held <b>April 25th-26th</b> at IRISA / Inria, Rennes, France, and is part of
                    <a href="http://www.brainhack.org/global2018">BrainHack Global 2018</a>, where a constellation
                    of such events happen simultaneously around the globe. Brainhack events convenes researchers from a
                    myriad of disciplines to work together on projects related to neuroscience. Similar to hackathons in
                    the tech sector, much of the schedule is left open for attendees to work together on projects of
                    their choosing. We also include “unconference” sessions where talks are chosen by the attendees
                    based on their interests as they evolve throughout the meeting. Brainhacks are not “coding sprints”
                    or exclusive to programmers, but rather are open to brain scientists from all backgrounds.</p>
		       
		    <p class="text-faded"><b>Hacking:</b> The core of Brainhack are “open hacking” sessions during which
                    attendees collaborate
		    together on projects of their choosing. Attendees who have specific project ideas or data that
                    they would like to explore are encouraged to submit their project below prior to the event. At
                    the opening of the Brainhack event, typically after the ice breaker, attendees pitch their ideas
	            and afterwards mingle with others to organize a project team. Teams work together throughout the
	            remainder of Brainhack and are given the opportunity to present their progress during the wrap-up
	            session at the end of the event.

		    <p class="text-faded"><b>Unconference:</b> Sessions for attendees to present their research or other
                    topics of current
	            interest. Immediately prior to these sessions, the agenda is determined on-site. Attendees who are
		    willing to present add their name to a sign-up sheet.</p>
			    
                    <p class="text-faded">Working papers on the outcomes from Brainhack Rennes can appear in the Gigascience Brainhack
                    Thematic Series, and shorter project reports from the event are eligible for the annual Brainhack
                    Proceedings.</p>
		       
                    <p>Thanks to generous support from Inria, registration is free, and includes
                    2 lunches and all coffee breaks. <a href="http://gipco-adns.com/site/6635/inscription+registration-brainhack+rennes+2018-"><b>Registration is now open!</b></a>.</p>
